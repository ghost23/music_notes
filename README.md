# music_notes

This flutter library (not actually a library at this point, more a dummy app)
wants to render music notation. There is tons of things still
missing. Currently it can only render staff systems (one or two), time signatures,
simple accidentals, bar lines and simple notes and simple note beams.

It also has a very basic musicxml parser, that only supports, what this library
is able to render.

I only work on this infrequently when I have time and feel like it ðŸ™‚
